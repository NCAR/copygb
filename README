COPYGB: A utility for copying and/or interpolating part
        or all of the contents of a file in GRIB1 
        format to another file in GRIB1 format


-------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING COPYGB
-------------------------------------------------------
To build copygb, type

  ./configure

and select the option for your particular machine. After configuring, type

  ./compile

to build the code.

To clean an old build (for example, after modifying source code), use

  ./clean -a

If the build is successful, the executable "copygb.exe" will be found in 
the bin/ directory

RUNNING COPYGB
-------------------------------------------------------
Copygb
 • Interpolates the forecasts horizontally from their native grid to a standard AWIPS or user-defined
   grid (for information on AWIPS grids, see http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/tableb.html).
 • Outputs the results in NWS and WMO standard GRIB1 format (for GRIB documentation, see
   http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/).


Sample command line for calling copygb:

  copygb.exe -xg"grid [kgds]" input_file output_file

where grid refers to the output grid to which the native forecast is being interpolated.

The output grid can be specified in three ways:

1. As the grid id of a pre-defined AWIPS grid number (gridno):
   copygb.exe -g${gridno} -x input_file output_file

   For example, using grid 218:
   copygb.exe -xg"218" WRFPRS_$domain.${fhr} wrfprs_$domain .${fhr}

2. As a user defined standard grid, such as for grid 255:
   copygb.exe -xg"255 kgds" input_file output_file

   where the user defined grid is specified by a full set of kgds parameters determining a GRIB GDS
   (grid description section) in the W3fi63 format. Details on how to specify the kgds parameters are
   documented in file lib/w3lib/w3fi71.f . For example:
   copygb.exe -xg" 255 3 109 91 37719 -77645 8 -71000 10433 9966 0 64 42000 42000" WRFPRS_$domain.${fhr} wrfprs_$domain.${fhr}

3. From a file: When WRF-ARW output is processed by unipost, a text file, copygb_hwrf.txt, is
   created. This file contain the GRID GDS of a lat/lon grid similar in domain and grid spacing to the
   one used to run the WRF-ARW model. The contents of this file can be read into the variable "nav"
   and can be used as input to copygb.exe.
   copygb.exe -xg"$nav" input_file output_file

   For example, when using copygb_hwrf.txt for an application, the steps include:
   read nav < 'copygb_hwrf.txt'
   export nav
   copygb.exe -xg"${nav}" WRFPRS_$domain.${fhr}
   wrfprs_$domain.${fhr}

It should be noted that copygb is a flexible program that can accept several command line options specifying
details of how the horizontal interpolation from the native grid to the output grid should be performed.
